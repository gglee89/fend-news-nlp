# About This Project

Udacity's FEND capstone project.

## Getting started

It would probably be good to first get your basic project setup and functioning. Follow the steps from the course up to Lesson 4 but don't add Service Workers just yet. We won't need the service workers during development and having extra caches floating around just means there's more potential for confusion. So, fork this repo and begin your project setup.

Remember that once you clone, you will still need to install everything:

`cd` into your new folder and run:
- `npm install`

## Extended Options
- Add END DATE and display length of trip;
- Persist travel schedule items in LOCAL STORAGE;
